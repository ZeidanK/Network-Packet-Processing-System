# Network-Packet-Processing-System

### Project Title:
**Network Packet Processing System**

### Bullet Points:
- Developed a comprehensive packet processing system in C, demonstrating proficiency in low-level programming and memory management.
- Implemented data structures such as linked lists and binary search trees to manage packet queues and routing tables efficiently.
- Utilized file I/O operations to read and write packet data from multiple input and output files.
- Applied bitwise operations and checksum validation techniques to ensure data integrity.
- Designed and implemented algorithms for packet enqueuing, dequeuing, and routing based on priority and destination address.
- Gained experience in debugging and optimizing C code for performance and reliability.
- Demonstrated ability to handle complex system design and integration tasks in a real-world networking context.
